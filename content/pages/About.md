##关于我
My name is Atlas 晓, currently [SICT][1] graduate. Research directions for [Realime OS][os], especially [Linux kernel2.6.33][kernel] with [real-time preemption patch][patch].

My research interests are very broad, up to now concerned about [Lunence][lucene], [Nutch][nutch], [spider][spider], [hadoop][hadoop], [big data][data], [android][android] and many other open source [projects][project], so I especially like the open source approach to learning.

Currently I am familiar with C and C + + language for Java, javascript, R Department of Language in the open source project has learned. Also Because often work under the Linux platform, so the python and shell more familiar with.

I study books "[30 homemade operating system][book1]"(a japanese writer) "[a operating system to achieve][book2]" and realize a simple operating system by myself, this successful implementation makes me happy for a long time,and learn a lot of knowledge.

The books are currently looking at "[Linux kernel is fully analyze - based on 0.12 kernel][book3]" and "[conquer python][book4]".

Please feel free to communicate with me!
